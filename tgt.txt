the star-crossed marriage between bahraini princess meriam al-khalifa and us marine johnson was once extensively feted on us television . however , it has come to an end in the desert gambling town of las vegas after only five years .
meriam is a member of the gulf country bahrain 's royal family . johnson risked his army career over their forbidden love affair , their fairy-tale marriage became the subject of a television movie .
but the las vegas review-journal reported that after only five years , the couple is headed to the court after meriam filed for divorce in the gambling town known for its quickie marriages and even quicker dissolutions .
the pair met in 1999 when career military man johnson was stationed in bahrain .
but his life changed dramatically when he met the beautiful teenage princess and the pair fell in love .
their union was forbidden by the royal family , so johnson disguised meriam in a flannel shirt and a baseball cap , forged her military identification papers and brought her out of her home country to america .
after a bitter immigration battle with us authorities , the couple finally married at the candlelight wedding chapel on the famed and glitzy las vegas strip when johnson was 23 and the bride only 19 .
however , johnson says that their star-crossed union comes to an end because of the temptations of the " sin city " of las vegas , the constant tensions with meriam 's rich and powerful family and rumors of an assassination plot against him .
johnson says his work was to park the cars of hotel and casino guests while meriam was increasingly tempted by the nightlife of the gambling city , frequenting clubs late at night and ignoring her husband .
